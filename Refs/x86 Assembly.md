Little-endian - Data is written from the right to the left. 

## CPU Instructions
- **mov** - Move data in and out of registers and the stack.
- **jmp**, jnz, jz -= Jump, a movement instruction. Logical branching. Looks for a condition to be met and make a jump to another part of the program depending on the condition outcome.
- **sub** - Subtract numbers from other numbers. Subtract locations in memory from the stack.
- **push** - Push data onto the top of the Stack. As data is pushed to the stack they are assigned lower addresses.
- **pop** - Pops data off the bottom of the Stack.
- **call** -Main ( ) Calls a function. 
- **ret** - Returns the outcome to of a function that was called to Main ( ).
## Memory Registers
32bit
- **eax** - Accumulator Register
- **edx** - Data Register
- **ebx** - Base Register
- **esp** - Extended Stack Pointer
- **ebp** - Extended Base Pointer. Register that can store the location to return to after jumping to another function. push ebp. 
-  **eip** - Extended Instruction Pointer - Current position of the running code in Assembly.

64bit
- rip
## The Stack
Grows downwards.  Top of the stack is the highest possible address in the stack for the program. LIFO Last in First out.
