Little-endian - Data is written from the right to the left. 

## CPU Instructions
- **mov** - Move data in and out of registers and the stack.
- **jmp**, jnz, jz -= Jump, a movement instruction. Logical branching. Looks for a condition to be met and make a jump to another part of the program depending on the condition outcome.
- **sub** - Subtract numbers from other numbers. Subtract locations in memory from the stack.
- **push** - Push data onto the top of the Stack. As data is pushed to the stack they are assigned lower addresses.
- **pop** - Pops data off the bottom of the Stack.
## Memory Registers

## The Stack
Grows downwards.  Top of the stack is the highest possible address in the stack for the program.

#### Stack
