A Command and Control attack is a type of attack that involves tools to communicate with and control an infected machine or network. To profit for as long as possible from a malware attack, a hacker needs a covert channel or backdoor between their server and the compromised network or machine. The cybercriminals server, whether a single machine or a botnet of machines, is referred to as the command-and-control server (C&C) server or [[C2]] server.
