# CTI Lifecycle
## Threat Intelligence Lifecycle

**The intelligence lifecycle is a process to transform raw data into finished intelligence** for decision making and action. You will see many slightly different versions of the intelligence cycle in your research, but the goal is the same, to guide a cybersecurity team through the development and execution of an effective threat intelligence program.

Threat intelligence is challenging because threats are constantly evolving – requiring businesses to quickly adapt and take decisive action. **The intelligence cycle provides a framework to enable teams to optimize their resources and effectively respond to the modern threat landscape**. This cycle consists of six steps resulting in a feedback loop to encourage continuous improvement:
### 1. Requirements

The requirements stage is crucial to the threat intelligence lifecycle because it sets the roadmap for a specific threat intelligence operation. During this planning stage, the team will agree on the goals and methodology of their intelligence program based on the needs of the stakeholders involved. The team may set out to discover:

- who the attackers are and their motivations
- what is the attack surface
- what specific actions should be taken to strengthen their defenses against a future attack

### 2. Collection

Once the requirements are defined, the team then sets out to collect the information required to satisfy those objectives. Depending on the goals, the team will usually seek out traffic logs, publicly available data sources, relevant forums, social media, and industry or subject matter experts.

### 3. Processing

After the raw data has been collected, it will have to be processed into a format suitable for analysis. Most of the time, this entails organizing data points into spreadsheets, decrypting files, translating information from foreign sources, and evaluating the data for relevance and reliability.

### 4. Analysis

Once the dataset has been processed, the team must then conduct a thorough analysis to find answers to the questions posed in the requirements phase. During the analysis phase, the team also works to decipher the dataset into action items and valuable recommendations for the stakeholders.

### 5. Dissemination

The dissemination phase requires the threat intelligence team to translate their analysis into a digestible format and present the results to the stakeholders. How the analysis is presented depends on the audience. In most cases the recommendations should be presented concisely, without confusing technical jargon, either in a one-page report or a short slide deck.

### 6. Feedback

The final stage of the threat intelligence lifecycle involves getting feedback on the provided report to determine whether adjustments need to be made for future threat intelligence operations. Stakeholders may have changes to their priorities, the cadence at which they wish to receive intelligence reports, or how data should be disseminated or presented.
