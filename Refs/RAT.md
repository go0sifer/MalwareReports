A Remote Access Trojan ([[RAT]]) is a tool used by cyber criminals to gain full access and remote control on a user’s system, including mouse and keyboard control, file access, and network resource access. Instead of destroying files or stealing data, a RAT gives attackers full control of a desktop or mobile device so that they can silently browse applications and files and bypass common security such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and authentication controls.

A RAT is designed to allow an attacker to remotely control a computer similar to how the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and TeamViewer can be used for remote access or system administration. The RAT will set up a command and control ([[C2]]) channel with the attacker’s server over which commands can be sent to the RAT, and data can be sent back. RATs commonly have a set of built-in commands and have methods for hiding their C2 traffic from detection.
